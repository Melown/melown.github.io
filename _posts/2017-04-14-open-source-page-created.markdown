[Melown Technologies SE](http://melown.com) is about to publish the whole 3D
mapping stack under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause). 

We are now preparing all components to be open sourced, they will be published
one-by-one on our [GitHub account](https://github.com/melown). We now can say,
that the first opened tool will be [vts-browser-js](/vts-browser-js) - the
JavaScript 3D WebGL rendering mapping engine.

We are looking forward to contribute to the open source software movement and
looking forward to new community and business opportunities, this step will
bring us.
